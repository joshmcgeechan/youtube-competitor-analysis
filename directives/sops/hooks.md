3.1 HOOK (30 SECONDS)
Purpose
What it does:

Creates curiosity loop
Establishes credibility
Makes a specific promise
Psychological goal: "This person can help me with my problem"
The 5-Part Hook Formula
PART 1: BOLD CLAIM OR SURPRISING FACT (5-10 seconds)
Start with something that challenges conventional wisdom, makes a contrarian statement, or presents surprising information.
Examples from top performers:
"Will editing your videos less make you more money? I believe the answer is yes."
"Do you know what Google, Starbucks, and TikTok have in common? None of them had an original idea."
"Everything you think you know about growing on YouTube is actually wrong."
Industry examples:
"Your sales calls feel awkward, pushy, and you avoid them at all costs." (Sales coach)
"Most SaaS companies die because they're solving the wrong problem." (SaaS founder)
"You're working 60 hours a week but your business isn't growing." (Business coach)
Pattern: Start with a contrarian take, surprising revelation, or bold promise that challenges what they think they know.

PART 2: CREDIBILITY MARKER (5-10 seconds)
Establish authority through specific numbers, results, or credentials.
Examples from top performers:
"After being paid to write more than 40 million views worth of content"
"We've been testing this for over 12 months and I got more comments, more leads, more sales"
"Evidence-based" + reference to NYT bestseller book
Industry examples:
"I've closed $2M in coaching contracts using this exact approach." (Business coach)
"After running 200+ product launches, I've seen what actually converts." (SaaS marketer)
"I went from 60-hour weeks to 4-hour days working with 20 clients." (Productivity coach)
Pattern: Specific numbers, real results, or unique experience. Never vague ("I've had success").

PART 3: SPECIFIC PROMISE (5-10 seconds)
Tell them exactly what they'll learn (not vague "tips and tricks").
Examples from top performers:
"I'm going to show you the new way to edit videos so that they pass on maximum value"
"These are the four strategies you can use to stop chasing original ideas"
"I'm going to show you what it took to get there, which videos made money, which ones didn't"
Industry examples:
"So in this video, I'm showing you the exact sales framework I use to close 70% of my calls." (Sales coach)
"I'm going to break down the positioning system that got me 100 customers in 90 days." (SaaS founder)
"I'm showing you how to work 4 hours a day and make more money than working 60." (Business coach)
Pattern: "I'm going to show you [specific thing]" or "I'll break down [specific framework]"

PART 4: TRANSFORMATION/BENEFIT (5-10 seconds)
Paint the outcome, the "why should I care" factor.
Examples from top performers:
"whilst growing your business in return. And you're going to like it because it's actually less work"
"I'm going to explain the invisible growth phase that happens before every channel's breakthrough and how to survive it"
"So they don't have to go back to recruitment because I've done it, it's terrible"
Industry examples:
"So you can close more deals without feeling pushy or salesy." (Sales coach)
"So you can find product-market fit in weeks, not years." (SaaS founder)
"So you can build a business that actually fits your life." (Business coach)
Pattern: "So that [transformation]" or "So you can [desired outcome]"

Complete Hook Examples
Example 1: Sales Coach

"Your sales calls feel awkward, pushy, and you avoid them at all costs.
And if nothing changes, you'll keep leaving money on the table, watching prospects choose competitors who aren't even better than you.
But sales doesn't have to feel that way. When you have the right framework, it feels like helping, not selling.
I've closed $2M in coaching contracts with a 70% close rate using this exact approach.
So in this video, I'm showing you the framework I use to turn sales calls from stressful to effortless.
So you can close more deals without feeling pushy or salesy."
Breakdown:
Bold claim: "Sales calls feel awkward..." (names their pain)
Credibility: "$2M closed, 70% close rate"
Promise: "Framework I use to turn sales calls from stressful to effortless"
Transformation: "close more deals without feeling pushy"


Example 2: SaaS Founder

"Most SaaS companies die because they're solving the wrong problem. They build for 6 months, launch, and nobody cares.
I've launched 5 products. Two failed completely. But the last one got 100 customers in 90 days.
So in this video, I'm going to show you the positioning system I used to find product-market fit in weeks, not years.
So you can stop guessing and start building something people actually want to pay for."
Breakdown:
Bold claim: "Most SaaS companies die solving wrong problem"
Credibility: "100 customers in 90 days after 2 failures"
Promise: "positioning system to find PMF in weeks"
Transformation: "stop guessing, build what people pay for"
